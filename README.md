This project uses the Vite/TS React template

**Difficulties:**

- no image url (solved by using a placeholder image as I did not think it to be an important part in this particular task, although I could have used some photo API);
- no ready design/ui kit (solved with own design solution, tried antd for the first time, went with bootstrap for react as I had prior experience);
- many features require complex state solutions (used react query and redux toolkit for complex things like pagination and useState for modals and order states);
- many components quickly grew in size (there are plenty more things that could be further refactored but I tried finding middle ground; it was a fun challenge as I had serious time constraints);
